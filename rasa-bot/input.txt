## MIRAC-PC Retrofit

This comprehensive retrofit transforms the MIRAC-PC Turning Center through a mechanical upgrade replacing stepper motors with high-performance Siemens servo motors and integrating a pneumatic chuck. Simultaneously, a deep system integration configures the Siemens 808D controller with an S7-1200 PLC and robust safety systems – including a safety curtain – establishing a modern control foundation.

The transformation extends into the digital realm with an IIoT platform leveraging ThingWorx and Kepware for real-time data monitoring via OPC UA communication. This enables critical features like predictive maintenance sensors, remote diagnostics, and real-time machine visualization/control. Crucially, a Digital Twin powered by Emulate3D provides live simulation and logic validation. Together, these elements – including OPC UA data exchange and advanced visualization – represent far more than a simple retrofit; they propel the machine into the future of intelligent manufacturing.

## TRIAC-PC Retrofit

This comprehensive retrofit transforms the TRIAC-PC Machining Center by replacing traditional stepper motors with Siemens servo motors for improved precision and performance. A pneumatic chuck system is also integrated to enhance workholding efficiency. The Siemens 808D controller is tightly coupled with an S7-1200 PLC and advanced safety mechanisms, including a safety curtain, ensuring high safety and automation standards.

Digitally, the TRIAC-PC is elevated with an IIoT layer using ThingWorx and Kepware, enabling real-time monitoring and OPC UA-based data communication. Features like predictive maintenance, remote diagnostics, and live control/visualization are now embedded into the system. A Digital Twin using Emulate3D supports simulation and logic validation. These upgrades together establish the TRIAC-PC as a cutting-edge intelligent machining solution for Industry 4.0 environments.

# Smart Stations

## Assembly Station
A hydraulic press specifically designed for assembly operations has been developed. Core control is handled by an OPC UA-enabled DELTA PLC, while precise stroke length feedback is provided by an LVDT. Operator safety is guaranteed with a safety curtain. To enable advanced capabilities, the press has been integrated into an IIoT platform (ThingWorx/Kepware using OPC UA), facilitating real-time data monitoring, predictive maintenance strategy implementation, remote diagnostics, and comprehensive machine visualization and control.

## Manual Inspection Station
This manual inspection station utilizes a Vernier Caliper interfaced with a PC via USB. The PC is connected to a central server, forming the foundation for its integration into an IIoT platform (ThingWorx/Kepware using OPC UA communication). The platform facilitates critical capabilities including real-time data monitoring, predictive maintenance strategies, remote diagnostics, and machine visualization/control.

## Performance Measuring Station
This performance measuring station predicts product end-of-life through sensor-driven machine learning. Fitted with requisite instrumentation (load cells, temperature sensors, etc.), it acquires test metrics under simulated operating conditions. As a node within the unified production system, it connects via standard OPC UA communication—identical to other stations—feeding data into centralized ML algorithms for lifespan modeling, reliability analysis, and failure forecasting.
